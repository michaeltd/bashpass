     2. dialog for a tty TUI.

     3. finally, xclip for some middle click password pasting functionality.

* Usage

** Use at your own risk!!!

   This author makes no claims, guarantees or promises of any kind!

   This project is nothing more than a UI/CRUD/SQL/PGP playground!

   So with that out of the way and If you're still around, let's move along ...

** tl;dr

   1. ~git clone https://github.com/michaeltd/bashpass && cd bashpass~

   2. ~./setup [sample.pgp]~

   3. ~Usage: bashpass [sample.pgp] [Xdialog|dialog|terminal] [--debug] [--help]~

** In detail

*** First time only:

**** [[https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html][Default gpg2 keyring]]

     If you don't already have one, make a [[https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html][default gpg2 keyring]].

**** Make and encrypt a ~sample.pgp~ SQLite3 file.

***** The easy way:

      Run ~setup [sample.pgp]~ from [[file:bashpass][bashpass]]'s directory.

      It'll create ~databases/sample~ SQLite3 and encrypt it as ~databases/sample.pgp~ to your personal keyring

***** The hard way:

      You'll need to build ~sample~ like so: ~sqlite3 databases/sample < examples/ac.sql~

      and encrypt it like so: ~gpg2 --default-recipient-self --output databases/sample.pgp --encrypt databases/sample~,

      Reason being SQLite3 ~sample~ file you'll work with, needs to be encrypted to your own keyring.

      All relevant files must reside in [[file:bashpass][bashpass]]'s directory.

*** Subsequent uses:

    For subsequent uses just fire up the script directly: ~bashpass [sample.pgp]~ from a terminal,

** Optional command line arguments

   - If you'd like to test other UI options try: ~bashpass [Xdialog|dialog|terminal]~, needless to say they have to be installed. If not ~bashpass~ will default to the highest available option in that order.

   - You can provide an SQLite3 database for use with ~bashpass~. That db needs to be encrypted to your personal keyring and have a ~.pgp~ extension.

   - The ~debug~ option will ~set -x~ to ~bashpass~, enabling it to echo commands in the terminal. To say the least: It's noisy!

   - Help will print out Usage and exit.

   - The order of arguments is irrelevant. ie: ~bashpass sample.pgp terminal~ == ~bashpass terminal sample.pgp~)

* Notes

  1. You can only have one instance of [[file:bashpass][bashpass]] running at any given time for obvious reasons. Internally enforced by a simple MUTEX implementation.

  2. Consider launching [[file:bashpass][bashpass]] with launch from terminal option enabled (where available, eg in dmenu: ~xterm -hold -e /path/to/bashpass [sample.pgp]~) as it will not run otherwise. For SQLite session availability, gnupg input and debugging purposes.

  3. Passwords generated by [[file:bashpass][bashpass]] are 64 character long ~[:graph:]~ type random strings (with some exceptions: ~[=\"=] [=\'=] [=\|=] [=\,=]~) from ~/dev/urandom~.

  4. GNU Privacy Guard file that'll be provided has to have a ~*.pgp~ extension. If no ~.pgp~ file parameter given, the script will default to ~sample.pgp~.

  5. After <2019-11-27 Wed> depending on xclip availability, if on Xdialog mode and on single record Create, Retrieve or Update operations, you'll be able to paste affected password via middle-click.

  6. Again... Not tested for production use at any load or capacity!

** Security concerns

   This script assumes you can secure the safety of your computer hardware/software at least for the duration of its operations.

   ~sample~ SQLite files used by this application get shredded upon quitting, otherwise a file recovery tool could recover unencrypted versions of them.

   Backup never hurt nobody [+.-]

   Add pgp2 encryption

** ✔ Clipboard
   CLOSED: [2019-11-27 Wed 02:21]
   Depending on xclip availability on Xdialog mode and upon single record Create,Retrieve,Update operations selected password will be copied to ~XA_PRIMARY~ xclip target (pasteable with middle mouse button), with it's trailing newline ('\n') removed.
